            <p>I chose to become a software developer because I love to solve problems that help people and businesses do more with less. Looking back, my most rewarding experiences have been projects where I was able help people leverage technology and eliminate wasted effort. I've included a link to my resume, but here are a few highlights of where I've been.</p>
            <p>My most recent experience was as the Director of Demand Planning at Dollar General. The Demand Planning team is obsessed with the future. We spent a majority of our time forecasting and thinking about the future. We were also responsible for building an maintaining many of the tools used by the supply chain team.</p>
            <p>It was during my time with the company that I started developing 'software' with whatever technology I had on hand. I was often the first stop when people encountered system or technical issues or if they had a great idea but didn't know how to implement it. Instead of continuing to give unqualified advice, I decided to leverage NSS to help me make the move to professional software developer.</p>
