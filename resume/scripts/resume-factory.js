/*
Create a resume.js file and include it in your resume.html file.
Build a database object to store the pertinent information about your professional history.
Stringify the database object and store it in local storage.
The first step is to design what each object's properties should be. Consider your written resume, and think about what information your provide to describe each job - title, company, dates, responsibilities. Each object should have those properties.
